# Summary

Float Pack riders will be grouped into teams. The objective of each time is to ride as far as possible within the time frame. Scattered around SF are Float Pack tags with QR codes. These QR codes link to challenges. Completing the challenges gives your team a Boost (ex. Double distance for 30 min), or allows you to Handicap other teams (ex. Walk your board for 15 min). There are also some challenges that allow you to Steal distance from competing teams. 

## Board Balancing
Teams must stick together, and have one rider on a Onewheel GT. The map size and riding speed are restricted accordingly. Gameplay is designed around 4 rides and 3 charge stops. Challenges marked with a âš¡ are Charge Challenges. These challenges have a 1-hour time window and must be completed without your board. Each team must complete 2 charge challenges. The lunch break and finale feature Head-to-Head Challenges for where teams can earn big miles.

## Endgame 

## Postgame Bonuses
Small bonuses will be given out to teams for the following superlatives:
- Most Challenges Complete
- Most Un-Adjusted Miles
- Longest Single Stint by Distance
- Most Handicaps Accrued

# Rules
## Distance Tracking
Each team has a designated score-keeper using OpenGPX Tracker
Teams must submit their current GPX track 10 minutes before the hour. For example, GPX must be submitted between 1:50pm and 2:00pm. Failure to submit GPX on-time incurs a 5 mi penalty. 
The scoreboard will be updated 10 minutes past the hour. For example, the scoreboard will be updated at 2:10pm. 
GPX gaps of >1min will NOT be counted towards your distance. 
GPX where speed is  >25mph will NOT be counted towards your distance.
All score-keepers must share live locations with referees and organizers via Find My for the duration of the event. 
## Challenge Tracking
To minimize GPX gaps due to memory issues, we recommend teams have a separate challenge-keeper to scan, record, and submit challenges. 
Distance covered while completing challenges are not counted unless otherwise specified.
You may forfeit a challenge at any time for a 5 mi penalty.
Challenges can only be completed once per-team. 
You must complete or forfeit your existing challenge before activating the next challenge.
Charge Challenges can only be completed once by any team, at which point they will be locked out of the game.
Teams must stick together! Teammates cannot separate to complete challenges. 
Hotline: if you have questions or need adjudication, call the hotline at 402-210-0638 for clarifications. 
Referees can dock distance or nullify challenges at any point for any reason.

## Other Rules
Participants will be given a coin, two 6 sided dice, playing cards, a hacky sack, a small tripod, and xxx to keep in their bags alongside hyper-chargers.
